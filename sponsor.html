          <h4>Establishing Your Presence</h4><br>
          <p>2019 ROCK FALLS BIG CAT QUEST CATFISHING TOURNAMENT September 28-29, 2019 SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES</p>

          <p>Illinois fishermen are among the most active and passionate in the nation and our goal with the 2019 Rock
            Falls Big Cat Quest Catfishing Tournament is to give them an outlet for this passion. We aim to make this
            tournament the biggest tournament to date, and would like to explore a partnership with your company in terms
            of sponsorship, in order to accomplish this goal. In 2016, this tournament had 42 boats and in 2017, 51 boats
            registered for the tournament. Last year was the first year we had to take over and rebuild after the
            unexpected passing of our organizer and promoter, but we expect over 60 boats in 2019. Our hope is to continue
            the fishing tournament in Rock Falls, IL for many years to come.</p>

          <h4>Why Rock Falls, Illinois?</h4>
          <p>We are fortunate to have one of our greatest assets in the Rock River. The most sought after sport fish in
            the Rock River are catfish. Both channel catfish and flathead catfish are abundant and of trophy size. In
            fact, the Rock River is one of the best rivers in the state for catching trophy size catfish, in the United
            States. With the river’s varying depths, fishermen need twice the special equipment. Some of the biggest
            catfish are caught in the shallows. Supporting a fishing tournament in Rock Falls, is an excellent marketing
            opportunity for your business and to create even larger brand loyalty. This tournament also has one of the
            highest payouts among fishing tournaments across the country.</p>

          <h4>Valuable Statistical Information</h4>
          <p>We have the Rock River. The most sought after of the sport fish in the Rock are the catfish, with both
            channel catfish and flathead catfish abundant and of trophy size. In fact, the Rock River is one of the best
            rivers in the state for catching trophy size catfish! With varying depths, fishermen need twice the special
            equipment. Some of the biggest catfish are caught in the shallows. Supporting a fishing tournament in Rock
            Falls, is an excellent marketing opportunity for your business. Anglers spent $387 million on equipment in
            Illinois in 2011, 40 percent of all fishing expenditures. Fishing equipment (rods, reels & lines, etc.)
            spending totaled $101 million-26 percent of the equipment total. Auxiliary equipment expenditures (tents,
            special fishing clothing, etc.) and special equipment expenditures (boats, vans, etc.) amounted to $287
            million – 74 percent of the equipment total.</p>
